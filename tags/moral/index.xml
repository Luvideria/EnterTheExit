      <description>a declaration or assurance that one will do something or that a particular thing will happen. Oxford Dictionary
 Honor Before writing became very common, words were used to bind people. &amp;ldquo;You have my word&amp;rdquo; is an expression very similar in meaning to a promise. The word &amp;ldquo;word&amp;rdquo; here implies that the act of saying a binding word or expression, such as &amp;ldquo;I will do X&amp;rdquo; is in itself binding.</description>
