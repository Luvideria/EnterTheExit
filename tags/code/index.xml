      <description>I always was very interested into fractals, notably I played quite a fair bit with Apophysis. That&amp;rsquo;s how I created these images:
As you can see, there was also transparency. They look very different on a white or on a black background, you can try (for the first two ones)
So it was really nice, but I had no idea how to render fractals. And I didn&amp;rsquo;t care.
Now the time has come.</description>
