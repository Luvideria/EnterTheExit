      <description>a declaration or assurance that one will do something or that a particular thing will happen. Oxford Dictionary
 Honor Before writing became very common, words were used to bind people. &amp;ldquo;You have my word&amp;rdquo; is an expression very similar in meaning to a promise. The word &amp;ldquo;word&amp;rdquo; here implies that the act of saying a binding word or expression, such as &amp;ldquo;I will do X&amp;rdquo; is in itself binding.</description>

      <description>Seed When we see a model in life, we generally tend to try, more or less consciously, to become more like it. Because we see something in this person that inspires us, or that feels so right, that we just want to take even just a piece of that for ourselves. Be it a value, a point of view, a character trait, many things can trigger this phenomenon.Is it his unbreakable determination?</description>

      <description>Disclaimer:  This &amp;ldquo;rant&amp;rdquo; is not about whether one diet is better than another on any aspect, it&amp;rsquo;s about how we treat these different diets. Does not mean I&amp;rsquo;m not biased toward one or the other, and hopefully it won&amp;rsquo;t be too problematic to you.
Problem setup  When you go to the restaurant, you need to check that your food is gluten free, lactose free, meat free, cruelty free, fish free, nut free or even other qualifiers.</description>
