GiveWell, Fairtrade, Fairphone, fantastic concept to find a significantly better way to help in their respective domain.
Donating money, buying such stuff are commendable actions.
Or are they?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
While it is obvious that these alternatives are better than many others in many aspects, should we be thanked for a donation?
Overall, how many people donate because they want to feel like they did a good thing?
Because they want to think better of themselves? Because a person who donates cannot be a bad person, can it?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Perhaps because they want to appear like a good person, telling others how generous they are.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Of course some people simply donate to help. They know this money will be well employed.
They don&rsquo;t need a thank you, they are the one thanking the ones doing the job.
They don&rsquo;t want to be thanked because they are truly affected by the reality of these children chewing wires to get the copper out in dumpsters.
They don&rsquo;t want to be thanked just because their donation helped ten or a hundred children.
They don&rsquo;t care, they just want these people to be protected from malaria.
They don&rsquo;t care, they just want people to go better.</p>
<p>And then you see someone saying that GiveWell is <em>for those who truly want to help</em>. It was not meant in a bad way. But it felt so precious, so above all else. I took it like a, &ldquo;please, dear, you&rsquo;re out of your mind if that&rsquo;s not how you do it.&rdquo;
While it is true that GiveWell ensures a close to optimal choice, isn&rsquo;t that just another layer to brag about?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Look, I&rsquo;m not just a generous person, among my myriad of other virtues, I am as well an intellectual: I donate to GiveWell.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Isn&rsquo;t that another way to feel greater, to feel even more virtuous? To feel superior to all these people donating to random organisations that either steals money and do very little, or are so inefficient that most of the money is wasted along the way.
As if they were the majority.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to face our own motives, the real purpose of our actions.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Are you here for a thank you letter? Are you here for your donation buffet?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 
Regardless of the state of your ego,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Spend a hundred to save lives. Probably better than spending a hundred in more or less meaningless gifts.</p>
<p>John Doe</p>
<p>Hey still here? Well, thank you for bearing with me. I didn&rsquo;t mean to be angry. I suppose it just conflicted with my values, and I felt like protecting them here.
Maybe there&rsquo;s nothing wrong about feeling better about yourself. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>John Doe</p>
