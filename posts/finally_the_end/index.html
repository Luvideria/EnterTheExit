<p>— You know, some other people are like me. I&rsquo;ve met some. We share the same story. You&rsquo;re down,
feeling terrible, worthless, you feel there is no salvation to your pitiful soul and you think, you&rsquo;re absolutely certain that you should&rsquo;ve been thrown in a bottomless pit long ago.
This oppressing darkness, strangling your throat, making you think threatening thoughts, desire derelict daydreaming and fear fathomless fantasy.
For some it&rsquo;s a terrible emptiness like a parasite eating all your pleasure, your joy to only let an abysmal void behind.
Some of us decide to take action. Some do it very quickly, at the peak of their pain, or out of fear that it becomes greater even.
I very well understand the extent to which some people are pushed by their sick mind, and they have all my compassion.<br>
Though to me it is&hellip; inelegant. Rough. It&rsquo;s a once in a lifetime craft, I think it deserves at least some sort of planning. Some prefer
it flashy, some prefer it quick, some prefer it painful, but most prefer it slow and progressive.
As for me, well, I decided it must be absolutely unspectacular. Something that evokes no pain and leaves no lasting scar in the
heart of the others. I have the chance to have received a scientific education, and biology, chemistry and physics
can help me to rest assured, I&rsquo;m not afraid to fail or suffer. Though, I know some may weep and I suppose it is a price to pay.<br>
I thought about a location and a mean devoid of any symbol. Nothing should give any hint, any idea about what was wrong.
It&rsquo;s happening, because that&rsquo;s how things are. Unfair.
After carefully designing my moment, I thought I would just carry out the plan.
But I just had to leave a message.</p>

<p>— And you want me to be the messenger?</p>

<p>— Maybe you can carry this one instead.<br />
Deciding on a date seemed unnecessary since I wanted to carry it out immediatly.
But in the meanwhile, I still had to prepare, and for this, I had to carry on for a while.
I surprised myself checking briefly left and right before crossing on my way to work.
It took me by surprise, I thought that it may be temporary, a simple effect of the excitement the planning had on me.
The reality was that I didn&rsquo;t want anything else than the planned way. And this very fact made me care.
It made me care about my body, my health, what&rsquo;s left of my morality and principles.
The only way to start caring was to prepare the ultimate mean to not care.
Nothing should stand before me and the promised release. Health issues are a distraction.
It gives meaning and reasons for someone to go. I don&rsquo;t want this to meddle with it.
I am almost smiling you know. Knowing it&rsquo;s all there, ready to fire at any time.
This very fact made me stonger somehow. It made me face situations in front of which past me would have given up.
I don&rsquo;t feel unbreakable but I feel protected.<br />
I know that whatever happens, the perfect exit door is open.<br>
I don&rsquo;t feel trapped in my life anymore. <br>
I feel free to choose.<br>
I feel free to go on.</p>

<p>Depression, mental illnesses, tough topic. Tough things happen to everyone and somehow, some can&rsquo;t figure out how to deal with it. So they break.
As human beings, they break. Their mind starts acting up and distorting everything around them. This in turns makes them have irrational, twisted views
of themselves, situations, the world. They are not stupid, they are dealing with a great foe.</p>

<p>sow_ay is a great artist making very interesting art about mental illness, mostly depression. I hope you don&rsquo;t relate to it ;) It was really great to have these drawings.
It somehow makes you feel less alone.</p>

<p>So this is an attempt at showing how convoluted, how weird and stupid these illnesses are. The situation can be anything really here.
Who&rsquo;s that messenger? Haaa&hellip; Could be me, could be a psychologist. Could be you. Who knows. Anyone who carries a message is a messenger.<br>
What do you carry?</p>

<p>The title refers to both the first and the second part, I like that.<br>
I also had fun with the weird sentence full of alliterations. Not particularly pretty or nice sounding, but fun nonetheless.</p>

<p>The warning is, I suppose, perfectly useless, but it&rsquo;s (possibly) important to state that this is unlike other poems about how great life can be.
But hey, that&rsquo;s how things are.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m happy I had these thoughts out of my head for now. They come and go. Could think you&rsquo;d get used to deal with those, but heh, somehow they always seem to get back to you.</p>
