<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, it may sound stupid but it&rsquo;s been like, years I&rsquo;ve had that problem! And I tried mostly everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Everything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wasn&rsquo;t very interested, but polite, according to the social conventions she learned.<br/>
But she finished her daily tasks long ago, so she didn&rsquo;t need to worry.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Well, I went to see my doctor first, he said I should get a better pillow. I have an amazing pillow now. I sleep much better, that&rsquo;s nice, I even stopped snoring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s something, you&rsquo;re no back to square one, at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She reoriented her wheelchair to be able to draw and listen at the same time.<br/>
She is drawing a werewolf on her notepad.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Mhh I suppose yes. But then the doctor said I may go to see a rheumatologist. He checked but apparently nothing was wrong with my problem. He said maybe I&rsquo;m using it too much, but it&rsquo;s not my 2 hours of weekly sport that would do that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all he said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t as boring as she thought, he&rsquo;s explaining quickly.<br/>
She was actually drawing the in-between stage, when it transforms.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Ah, of course he made some scans and stuff. The big machine was very impressive. He said I have a begining of arthrosis. But since I&rsquo;m young enough, it should not progress too much thanks to the physiotherapy. Everything else is good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Are they just going to bounce you off another specialist all the time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some reason, she ended up drawing his face on the transforming werewolf.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;I said to the physiotherapist about my neck and she tried her best. It actually helped a bit, but it kept coming back. Though she put my shoulder back in place after my bicycle accident, she did wonders really. Though she said it can be stress, and that this problem should be taken care of before coming back to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look like a stressed out person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was wondering how long he would stay. She needed him to stay a bit more for her to draw.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;I suppose. The psychiatrist was very competent. He actually helped me get rid of my arachnophobia. But concerning stress, as you said, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s hilarious how no one gives you what you want but you end up with something fixed anyway. So that&rsquo;s the end of the adventure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started to like it. She was drawing the tail.
His voice was rather deep, and she found it charming in a way.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Almost. I decided to go to this Reiki person a friend of mine suggested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Let me guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was not into that.
But she was very into werewolves.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, basically it did the same thing as the physiotherapist, it went better for the following days and it came back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Did she have any insight as to why this happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was drawing ripped-off clothes now.
She smiled when she imagined what was below his shirt.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know. She said the energy flowed very well, that I&rsquo;m very open. Whatever that means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;The energy flows hmm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She finds his way of looking at her pretty intense, and that sure made something flow.
She decided to draw a big belt to hide her thoughts.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Yes and apparently I&rsquo;d have a sort of energy leak or something, maybe I&rsquo;m not using proper words, I don&rsquo;t know much about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;What are you supposed to do about it? Put an energy plug?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought a bit of sarcasm couldn&rsquo;t hurt.
She was trying to add some sharp teeth.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Well, she told me to come back. The second time, after the session she said that I should probably eat healthier and be more mindful about it, that it would help with my digestion and make me a more wholesome person, thus helping with the leak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;So you became vegetarian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was her definition of healthy. No one is perfect okay.
She was more and more interested in this new officemate.
And she was adding some muscles here and there.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Not really, but I&rsquo;m more mindful. I care about where the things I buy come from. Actually, it made me gain a real interest in food. There&rsquo;s so many more ingredients than I thought!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;I know right? Talking about chia seeds, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chia seeds have interesting properties indeed.
And so have the eyes she is refining.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Well, actually I noticed that digestion is easier, so there&rsquo;s that. The woman was right. But it still hurts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s no solution?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She added some shadows and some more hair.
As she was drawing unrealistically fast for the needs of the scenario, she had to sharpen her pencil.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m aware of. Oh it&rsquo;s already so late? I&rsquo;m heading out. Cheers&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Oh okay. Cheers I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was surprised how abrupt it was.
She would have liked to hear more. He voice was soothing. And her drawing wasn&rsquo;t finished.
She went to the window to observe him leave. He went past her car. She cannot stand much but her right leg works well enough to drive an automatic car.
She would stay until even later, for she doesn&rsquo;t really have anything else to do.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Where did I put my bike already?&rdquo; he said as he was looking the wrong way.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Ah&rdquo;. He found it. Good job. He put his helm on, turned on his bike light. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s already eleven, why is she staying in the office so late?&rdquo;, as he said that, he closed the door of the bike shed.
He was out. The air is fresh, but not cold. The wind is calm, waking up for a few cuddles with his raincoat. No cloud to be seen tonight.<br/>
&emsp;She was finishing her drawing, and she drew the immense rock in the sky. Bright. He looked up, as everyday, mesmerized by the light, by the creases, by the craters, by its presence.
He couldn&rsquo;t detach his eyes from it. Once or twice he almost missed a red light. He really does have the head in the clouds. But he&rsquo;s used to it, he does that every evening.
Every evening he looks up the sky. And everytime, he feels the warmth of the moon, much warmer than the one of the sun. Like a hug, like a dear friend. Shining on him with all its love. Sometimes he feels overwhelmed and a tear falls on the hard ground of the bicycle road.<br/>
And sometimes he would stop on the bench near his home to watch the moon. The Milky Way, the stars, the nebulas. Here since forever and here forever. Nothing in the sky will change during his life, and he takes his time to comtemplate.</p>

<p>She left everything on her desk. She left the office.
Driving her car along the mountain as everyday. She stops just in front of a very dangerous turn, considering the opportunity. Just above, a big, round, bright circle of faraway. She looks to the cliff again.</p>

<p>&emsp;&ldquo;Not today old friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally home, after watching the sky during the 30minutes it takes to go home, he was taking off his clothes and heading to bed after the usual bathroom moment. And as his head touches his pillow he mutters: &ldquo;Aaaargh my neck again!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This guy is kinda weird, talking this much to someone he barely knows. But I think he&rsquo;s minding his own business most of the time.
I like how it begins, just right in the middle of the conversation. I think I did that for an effect of &ldquo;something&rsquo;s happening&rdquo;. Maybe also because it&rsquo;s fairly long, and the idea I had was fairly short and straightforward.
But I hope you&rsquo;re also interested in how this guy is built now <em>wink</em>.</p>

<p>The girl was really into him, but she&rsquo;s obviously not going well. (Just a bit suicidal). She makes me think a lot about someone that used to be a friend.</p>

<p>I relate a lot to this man, watching the moon, for I do the same on the way home. I hope that you, at least, figured what was going wrong with his neck&hellip;</p>

<p>There would probably be some interesting analysis to do like when she is drawing sharp teeth and she was being sarcastic, one could say she was drawing the teeth of the sarcasm. It bites you just like that.
Or how the protagonist is never described by the narration until he leaves, and then even he is joined by her, not separated by a new line. Maybe indicating that they are somehow linked together tonight. More precisely that she is linked to him.
So who&rsquo;s the protagonist in the end? But that&rsquo;s already too much analysis and I see you being glad it&rsquo;s the end of the page. But hehe, there&rsquo;s a lot of text coming up sooner or later!</p>

<p>The image is from the video game To The Moon. Nice. Non-combat video game. Story driven. Nice gameplay. Cool references. Above average soundtrack. <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.</p>
