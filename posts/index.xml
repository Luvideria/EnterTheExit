<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>First of all there is one difficult word in there : <em>hearth</em> which designates the floor of the fireplace.
To appreciate this poem, I recommend you to look in the vague (outdoors if possible) and do not fix anything at all, just blurry vision, for like 30 seconds. No, not right now, at the end of the intro. Take a deep breath. Now look away and then don&rsquo;t be distracted by anything.</p>

<h2 id="celcius">Celcius</h2>

<div class="centeredBlock">


You know, they say it's warm.<br/>
And they say it warms your heart.<br/>
And even that some people smile.<br/>
But... My thermometer is broken. How can I find out ?<br/><br/>
I tried to remember the warmth of the sun,<br/>
I think I caught sunburns.<br/>
I tried to remember the warmth of the hearth,<br/>
My eyes were lost in the ashes.<br/><br/>
But nothing makes sense.<br/><br/>
Because when I think about it,<br/>
And I find my tears flowing,<br/>
I know there is more.<br/><br/>
You, who knows everything,<br/>
Could you tell me<br/>
The temperature of a hug ?

</div>


<h1 id="manifest">Manifest</h1>

<p>I know, the intro is weird, but I feel like if you just arrive here with all your thoughts and wanting to read quickly the new post of your acquaintance and then be done with it, you&rsquo;re not really in the right mood see why just below.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>This poem was made during a fairly dark period of my life. A permanent struggle at the time. I was terribly lacking human contact, be it social or physical (hugs are drugs). I was sick, my mind was barely working. I wanted to share my confusion about how trivial things can become complicated. But in a cute way.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>Once again, I imagine the character talking to be a little girl (and is it&rsquo;s a mirror of myself, maybe it&rsquo;s the little girl I was always forbidden to become).<br/>
I like the idea of trying to show that things that we take for granted, can be much deeper than at first sight. And for this, what&rsquo;s best than a fresh look on life: children. They look at everything and discover their emotions with the eye of discovery. And from time to time, they point something that we overlooked or had long forgotten.<br/>
Even widg that said, I find it kind of childish but not in the right way, I&rsquo;m talking about the writer. It feels clumsy. Also I think there is potential for beautiful imagery here, but it could not go out of his brain. Let&rsquo;s be kind to the sick me.<br/>
I think that &ldquo;temperature of a hug&rdquo; is a beautiful image, and it love it. It&rsquo;s saddening that I left it this way, it could have been so much more. Because I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin this image, I called the poem Celcius.<br/>
Oh by the way here is my inspiration:</p>


<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3NftUsNp8W0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>


<p>It is from a mobile music game I love tremendously: <a href="https://www.rayark.com/g/deemo/">Deemo</a>. It made me discover th artist: V.K. The song is indeed called 擁抱的溫度, or Temperature of a hug if, like me, you don&rsquo;t speak Chinese.</p>

<p>Yes, I know. Well it&rsquo;s not like I had any pretention whatsoever.</p>

<h2 id="side-note">Side note</h2>

<p>Here is the background I used for this page (still trying out features!). I took this a while ago, it&rsquo;s a fancy bokeh effect. The person who guesses how I took it gets uuuh, pancakes. No, it&rsquo;s cheatung if I told you already! But I&rsquo;m never out of pancakes to be honest :D. By the way, I find this background way too dim. I need to fiddle with this

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I always had a keen interest into fractals, I played quite a fair bit with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophysis_(software)">Apophysis</a>. That&rsquo;s how I created these images:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DRx1nmv/Grand-Julian.png" alt="Grand-Julian" /></p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Fgt4nWm/Piatch.png" alt="Piatch" /></p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/th66ZGb/triancore.png" alt="triancore" /></p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/qgdm7br/Triangula.png" alt="Triangula" /></p>

<p>As you can see, there was also transparency. They look very different on a white or on a black background, you can try (for the first two ones)</p>

<p>Fractals give me a sentiment of infinite complexity, and complexity looks mesmerizing to me. Especially structured complexity, like see how in the Grand-Julian there is usage of symmetry, and also patterns like these circles waving around the red part? Also the symmetry is only an illusion, because looking carefully, the global idea is the same on both side but it&rsquo;s variating, always redefining itself.
I like that, I just can&rsquo;t help it. It&rsquo;s so abstract, so deep, but at the same time it&rsquo;s just a big fat math equation, tailored by myself to unravel its fierce elegance under the form of an image. <strong>takes a deep breath</strong></p>

<p>So it was really nice, but I had no idea how to render fractals. And I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>Now the time has come. I&rsquo;ve already written my own (crappy) pathtracer so it cannot be so hard.
I understand how raytracing works. But I never had the chance to learn about ray marching.</p>

<p>So I fiddled with python and found some ressources on internet (where else ?)
I wanted to have as few info as possible, and I wanted to solve all the problems myself.</p>

<p>Of course there are the <code>rayMarch()</code> function and the <code>Camera</code>.</p>

<h2 id="parallel-with-ray-tracing-and-further-explanations">Parallel with ray tracing and further explanations</h2>

<p>Basically only two things differ from normal ray tracing:</p>

<ul>
<li>intersection function does not really exist anymore</li>
<li>objects are represented by a signed distance function</li>
<li>your ray is litterally taking small steps to go traverse the scene</li>
</ul>

<p>The process goes this way:</p>

<ul>
<li>define objects (like spheres) with SDF corresponding to their parameters (radius, position, color)</li>
<li>choose an origin $O_r$ for your ray (like, not too far not too close)</li>
<li>choose a direction $d$ for your ray (straight on a sphere is good)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, Rey Marching begins</p>

<ol>
<li>then compute the $SDF(O_r)$ for all objects in your scene</li>
<li>take the minimum of it, let&rsquo;s call it <del>Oscar</del> $msdf$</li>
<li>advance your ray of $msdf$ in the direction d (so it is $newO_r=O_r+msdf$)</li>
<li>then you repeat using the $newO_r$</li>
<li>check if the sdf is EPSILON or less, if it&rsquo;s the case then you intersected, report the color value

<ul>
<li>EPSILON is here for some more tolerance (floating point errors or stuff can happen)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>If you do that, you will loop indefinetely so best thing is to impose a hard limit to the distance the ray can travel
Another solution would be to compute the bouding box of the scene (if at all, possible) and to measure the distance from the ray to the farthest point of it. But well, I just use 50, it&rsquo;s a good number.</p>

<p>You can also impose a number of maximum steps, and if the ray is misbehaving, (doing too many small steps) hop, background color</p>

<p>Now, you say, that does not make an image!
Of course we need a camera. But that&rsquo;s maths and all, so let me just say that you give the camera a position to be, a position to look at, and boom, you&rsquo;re set.</p>

<p>Now that we have a camera, we call the very convenient function <code>getPixelDir(i,j)</code> that gives us the direction or the ray</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we want a 1080p image, our image is $w=1920$ pixels wide and $h=1080$ pixels high</p>

<ul>
<li>loop $w$ times:

<ul>
<li>loop $h$ times:</li>
<li>$d=getPixelDir(i,j)$ ($i$,$j$ are the current loop number for $w$ and $h$ loops)</li>
<li>$p=getCameraPos$</li>
<li>$color=rayMarch(p,d)$</li>
<li>$img[i,j]=color$</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>boom done. Do that and, like me, you obtain THIS:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/nkQskTc/first.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Incredible huh?</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s shit, but what did you expect? there is no lighting, no bounce of the light. All this is for a real renderer.</p>

<p>okay, let me add the cos term so that it looks like actual balls at least:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/PWBG7XZ/3balls.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>I just wanted to see how it works but now, I need to get on the fractal train.</p>

<p>And I have to say, python sucks! It&rsquo;s so damn slow!</p>

<h2 id="text">Text</h2>

<p>I have a dragon in my room. One may ask &ldquo;Show me your dragon&rdquo; but I cannot. Sadly, it is small, very very small. And it is fast, very very fast. One may ask &ldquo;Then how do you know it exists ?&rdquo; Well it&rsquo;s simple. Sometimes I feel like I tripped over something but no cable, no furniture just a perfectly flat floor, as if it just carelessly bumped into me. I regularly sense a peculiar yet very faint smell, like something caught fire. Though after inspection, nothing burnt, no cooking, no worn out cable or electronic device going crazy. It can only be the fiery breath of the dragon, probably roasting its meal. I have no idea about what this dragon eats though. Maybe it picks something from the trash ? Or maybe it steals from the fridge ? I never noticed such a thing, but I suppose such a tiny dragon doesn&rsquo;t need much. A fly or two from time to time may very well be enough for all I know&hellip; One may say &ldquo;Oh but that&rsquo;s nothing, you&rsquo;re probably imagining stuff&rdquo;. I can only tell you what I experience, but I cannot make you experience my feelings. Let me tell you more about the dragon.</p>

<p>When the wind chimes through my shutters and the sky covers itself of its starry blanket as my consciousness fades, I can hear it, I can feel it. Just next to my head, a calm breathing, a warm breeze.
As soon as I try to gather my still sleeping thoughts, it vanishes. I try to place my hand where I felt it but the mattress isn&rsquo;t warmer, the air isn&rsquo;t agitated, it simply disappeared. But it was here.
Once I was sick and I had terrible stomach pain. Going to sleep was awful, I couldn&rsquo;t get rest because of the pain, but couldn&rsquo;t stay awake because I was exhausted.
When the clouds made everything dark and the wind howled its best to free the stars, I lost myself to exhaustion. A soft warmth pressing against my belly, just like a hot stone, perfectly adjusted.
The hard scales heated up by the ardent inner fire of the dragon made for a very regenerating sleep. The sun just began to rise when I noticed that I slept on the back. I never sleep
on the back. I thought it was because of the stomach pain, maybe this position helps. But after testing, the pain is actually more intense when my body is on the back because the whole belly is extended compared to foetal position. I can only think it was to allow the dragon to heal me somehow. My stomach pain was significantly better this day, and although I was not cured, my state was now tolerable.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/4j24jxf/DSCF2229.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<p>I do not need you to believe in my dragon, my dragon is very real for me and I like him very much. I believe he is my friend and in any case I will always welcome him and his friends. But I do not care if someone does not believe in my dragon. You might be a scientist thirsty for knowledge, or a psychologist looking for an interesting case. Maybe you want to capture my dragon and study him, or make me sit and interrogate me. Maybe you just want to prove me I&rsquo;m wrong, that my dragon is nothing but delusions of an imaginative mind. Maybe. But I won&rsquo;t let you kill my dragon.</p>

<p>You are not allowed any experiment. You are not allowed to make me understand what I actually tripped over or that the sound I heard was something else entirely. You are not allowed to make me doubt that the warmth I felt wasn&rsquo;t his. My dragon will live on until he decides to leave.</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>The picture is from me, during a trip in Belle-île. One of my first pictures of the stars. My fuji x100s in not made for that, and to be honest, I don&rsquo;t like it so much anymore (the picture, not the camera).
I added it when doing the post, more to see how to put images and figure out a way to put them online easily.</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>When I wrote this poem I was still active on a forum and there I exchanged with people persuaded by astrology, by Christiannism, by a lot of beliefs that sometimes hurt them more than they help. Some of them were very depressed.</p>

<p>I wanted to share a part of my understanding of this situation.</p>

<p>I feel sorry that they need to go this far in the nonsense to find salvation. Yet, they do feel better, some people find in these something that society, psychiatrists or their job do not offer. And that is not their fault.</p>

<p>And this is very good and I am delighted that they find something that works for them.</p>

<p>Yet they start to build a sentimental, emotional bond with it. And as the little girl (I imagine that, but it&rsquo;s sexist, sorry) will outgrow her enthusiastic imagination, they should also outgrow their beliefs. Not in the sense that they should part with them, in the sense that it is not needed anymore. In the state I saw a lot of people (a lot is actually not even statistically sensible, but it&rsquo;s more than most people dealt with) they were like imprisoned by their beliefs. They could not evolve enough to be able to choose if they wanted to live with or without.
This is saddening.</p>

<p>This is a topic (&ldquo;outgrowing beliefs&rdquo;) that I am fairly sensitive to. I think I have a lot of things to think about on this topic.</p>

<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>

<p>I decided to share this as-is, without modifications, even if I think I could improve it. (It was written 5 months ago)</p>

<p>I like the way it sounds childish, but the end feels off. It does not feel like a child anymore, and it&rsquo;s more all the frustration that was in me that talked. In some sense, I feel like a gradient of childishness in this poem. Maybe that&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>Very little rewriting happened (I would definitely use different images instead of twice stars : &ldquo;starry blanket&rdquo;, &ldquo;free the stars&rdquo;)
but at the time I had no intention to publish it, so I did not really care.</p>

<p>I wanted to illustrate how people end up getting into these.. fields? esoterism? I don&rsquo;t really know, but you get it: mostly irrationnal stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Confirmation bias</strong>: Looking for proofs that aren&rsquo;t really there, ignoring all the clues that point in other directions
The stone moment illustrate how vicious life can be at giving you information.</p>

<p>It can look like you got better, but actually the night was just nice and the sleep was in the end of good quality. In any case she would feel better and better. Let&rsquo;s not neglect placebo effect that may very well apply here.</p>

<p>There is also this tendency to not use <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Ockham&rsquo;s razor</a></strong>: she thinks it was to help the dragon heal her that she slept on the back but it could be a misplaced pillow because, while trying to get asleep, she kept moving around, moving pillows, or whatever other reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus pumila). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
