<p>&emsp;This &ldquo;rant&rdquo; is not about whether one diet is better than another on any aspect, it&rsquo;s about how we treat these different diets. Does not mean I&rsquo;m not biased toward one or the other, and hopefully it won&rsquo;t be too problematic to you.</p>

<h2 id="problem-setup">Problem setup<a href="#problem-setup" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>&emsp;When you go to the restaurant, you need to check that your food is gluten free, lactose free, meat free, cruelty free, fish free, nut free or even other qualifiers. It is usual nowadays that a restaurand would have a section dedicated for one or multiple of these specificities. In this &ldquo;essay&rdquo; I will try to challenge the very idea of assigning these kind of labels to food.</p>

<p>&emsp;People have different and sometimes incompatible diets. Above all else, this is a fact that we must simply respect for the simple reason that everyone should be free to choose to not eat something. This is the assumption upon which the rest is built.</p>

<p>&emsp;Putting these tags on a menu is a way to indicate to certain specific persons if they will be able to eat this particular dish.</p>

<h2 id="proposal">Proposal<a href="#proposal" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>&emsp;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be much more sensible to indicate it the other way around?</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why&rsquo;, you&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;it works well like that.&rsquo;<br/>
Glad you asked.<br/>
<u>Let&rsquo;s take an example:</u><br/>
&ndash; <span style="color:#cfffdb;">Hey buddy you remember this dude that we didn&rsquo;t meet in college?</span><br/>
&ndash; <span style="color:#cff5ff">What?</span><br/>
&ndash; <span style="color:#cfffdb">You know, the guy that doesn&rsquo;t have long hair, who happen to not wear baseball caps?</span></p>

<p><u>Alternate version:</u><br/>
&ndash; <span style="color:#cfffdb">Hey buddy you remember this dude from high school?</span><br/>
&ndash; <span style="color:#cff5ff">Which one?</span><br/>
&ndash; <span style="color:#cfffdb">You know, the guy with blond short hair that was taller than you?</span></p>

<p>&emsp;Obviously one is more sensible than the other. Because we describe things by what they are, not by what they aren&rsquo;t.
When things are mutually exclusive it works very well to use one or the other.</p>

<p><u>Example:</u><br/>
&ndash; <span style="color:#cfffdb">Hi buddy, how&rsquo;s it going?</span><br/>
&ndash; <span style="color:#cff5ff">Not bad, not bad, you?</span><br/>
<u>And:</u><br/>
&ndash; <span style="color:#cfffdb">Hi buddy how&rsquo;s it going?</span><br/>
&ndash; <span style="color:#cff5ff">Fairly fine, and you?</span></p>

<p>&emsp;Here, no problem because you are either going fine or not. There&rsquo;s no mistake. This is not so similar with food.
Indeed you either do want or do not want to eat something. Yet because people have different opinions for each and every foodstuff (in their good right), it is only fair to let them decide if it&rsquo;s okay by saying what&rsquo;s inside and not selecting some choices about what&rsquo;s not inside.<br/></p>

<h2 id="argument">Argument<a href="#argument" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>&emsp;An interesting argument is scalability. If you say what&rsquo;s inside, everyone can make its choice. By selecting some subgroups and targeting the &ldquo;main focus&rdquo; of this subgroup, every person that has slightly different views or needs cannot necesarily know whether it&rsquo;s good for them. One person, even not knowing any other subgroup&rsquo;s preferences, should be able to choose the food they are okay with.</p>

<p>Another example came to my mind:</p>

<p>&emsp;Let&rsquo;s say you own a tavern, and there are more than fifty races, all with different eating habits, all with different preferences. Hobgobelins, orcs, humans, elves, dwarves, ifrits, kobolds and more! (it&rsquo;s a very inclusive tavern, and also modern in the sense that they would be at our technology level)<br/>
Because you are a careful owner who wants everyone to get the food they want, you need to label the food in some fashion so that orcs won&rsquo;t eat the leaves that they can&rsquo;t digest, elves won&rsquo;t eat meat and kobolds won&rsquo;t eat the ashes of the ifrits (kobolds are dumb).</p>

<p>Will you say &ldquo;hobgobelin, orc, dwarf can eat this dish&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Fox-person-suitable food&rdquo; ?
No of course, it&rsquo;s stupid, you just declare what&rsquo;s inside, and every person can ask for the dish they want.</p>

<p>&emsp;And yet the crazy per-category labelling is happening.
Gluten free, lactose free, ketogenic, vegetarian or vegan or even pescetarian or more.
The scalability really shines here, because once the labelling per ingredient is done, it is enough for all possible habits.</p>

<h2 id="counter-argument">Counter Argument<a href="#counter-argument" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>&emsp;A counter argument would be that some ingredients of importance may appear sooner or later. This is true, gluten is not an obvious thing to include in the ingredient list. Yet lactose intolerance and gluten intolerance are like allergies in this regard. We can expect that there would be a list of common (and there is!) of common allergens. This list may be updated as the relevant authority sees it fit.</p>

<p>&emsp;Of course if only different tastes were involved, it would not be so necessary.
But there are medical, ethical, environmental and maybe more reasons to consume or not a given food, and that does not make every food equal.</p>

<p>&emsp;Some may also say that it is already done on the back of the products you buy (this ignores the restaurant problem). Indeed products have their composition written.<br>
Here we are talking about labelling, meaning having a symbol or a group of symbols that would &lsquo;summarize&rsquo; the relevant informations. Basically what is done at the moment.</p>

<p>&emsp;Some eating habits also include in their selection the way the product has been made. Fair trade, vegan (it&rsquo;s not just not consuming animal products but not having anything from animal exploitation). So for instance, coconut seems fine for a vegan. WELL it depends. Some coconut is harvested using monkeys to climb the trees and gather coconuts. Even if the monkey is not being mistreated, this is not, strictly speaking, vegan. Some vegan would draw different &ldquo;thresholds&rdquo; for these questions, but it&rsquo;s not the topic at hand. <br/>
&emsp;This was a mere tentative to show how being perfectly inclusive seem difficult.</p>

<p>&emsp;Though, technology could help us with for instance a qr code that would link you to the complete info. But this is a complex system.</p>

<h2 id="even-tempered-argument">Even-tempered argument<a href="#even-tempered-argument" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>I understand the reassuring feeling that you may have if you are intolerant (or allergic) to something and you see &ldquo;thing-free&rdquo; label on the food. This is perfectly understandable when it&rsquo;s a question of life or death. I don&rsquo;t really have anything to say about it. Especially that suing someone for mislabelling is hard when you&rsquo;re dead (even though corpses are fairly hard too).</p>

<h2 id="a-cultural-problem">A cultural problem ?<a href="#a-cultural-problem" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>&emsp;If in your community, the norm would be to never eat food X (religion is what comes to mind first for me) then the food would be explicitly labeled &ldquo;contains X&rdquo; because this food is &ldquo;not standard&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&emsp;Hence in a society where eating meat is standard, wheat flour is common and milk the base of most sauces, it seems logical that we ended up labelling it this way. When you enter in a &ldquo;green&rdquo; restaurant, you expect everything to be organic, so nothing is labeled as organic. Some specific foodstuff might not be though and they would specifically point it. Same with a vegetarian-oriented-but-meat-eater-frienly-restaurant. Vegetarian would be what you expect, therefore meat would be labeled as such.</p>

<h2 id="sort-of-an-argument-i-guess">Sort of an argument I guess<a href="#sort-of-an-argument-i-guess" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>&emsp;But anyway, is this practice of labelling good, is it bad?</p>

<p>On one hand I would say that it&rsquo;s not so important as long as you end up eating what you want.</p>

<p>On the other hand&hellip;</p>

<p><u>Strong opinion ahead:</u><br/>
I repeat what I said before for clarity.<br/>
disclaimer: I said at the begining that it wasn&rsquo;t about which diet is best, and since here it&rsquo;s heavily opinion based, I will heavily bias the way I present the arguments (that I could have done in a diet-neutral way but choose not to).</p>

<p>It does not make sense to put labels &ldquo;vegetarian&rdquo;, &ldquo;vegan&rdquo; or whatever else like that on a menu.
What would make sense is &ldquo;made this way with x,y,z&rdquo; then you decide whether x,y, or z is a problem to you or not.<br/>
This would dramatically change the mindset.<br/>
&ldquo;this contains meat&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;and eggs&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;and cheese&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;and nuts&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;and cow&rsquo;s milk&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;and was cooked with butter&rdquo;</p>

<p>&emsp;People would get a much better view of what they are eating. Yes, most people eat meat everyday and close to every meal. I know for I did the same. Okay, you&rsquo;ll tell me that you know what you are eating since it&rsquo;s litterally the name of the dish you ask for. Yes. Though, there is no contrast with no-meat-options, since those are hidden behind their &lsquo;vegetarian label&rsquo;
And since things are labeled &ldquo;vegetarian&rdquo; oh why boy, you&rsquo;re not vegetarian, why would you take this?<br/>
This is damaging. It separates people, as if not being vegetarian makes you unable to appreciate a vegetarian meal.<br/>
&emsp;That is at least how I felt. &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;ll try this vegetarian thing&rdquo; &ldquo;oh it&rsquo;s not that bad&rdquo;. Duh. It&rsquo;s the same food, just balanced differently. Even people eating with me would be surprised like &ldquo;oh you&rsquo;re vegetarian&rdquo;. <br/>
&emsp;The very fact that I thought &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try this vegetarian thing&rdquo; is a problem, it should not feel like it&rsquo;s from another planet. And we make it this way by labelling things with &ldquo;vegan&rdquo;, &ldquo;vegetarian&rdquo;.<br/>
It&rsquo;s not for someone who belongs to a group, it&rsquo;s for everyone who&rsquo;s okay with eating that. And people most definitely are because that&rsquo;s what they eat all the time, except we switched one ingredient or two.</p>

<p>This is valid for groups that are fully included one in the others.<br/>

<p>&emsp;Both sides have a fairly good argumentation, and I did&rsquo;t give every possible argument.
Looking at these, I opt for the paradigm change. The reason is that this solution would blur the limit of the social transition and social weight to go from $O$ down the chain (I am <strong>not</strong> implying here that further down is best, this is for another time). My reasons for this are the same that made me reflect on my dietary habits.  It is also a good thing in another sense: if more people (the pool of $O$ people is quite big) consume &ldquo;vegetarian&rdquo; options, more &ldquo;vegetarian&rdquo; options will be available. And one of my reasons for wanting this is obviously that I like having many things to choose from. Meanwhile, we have to stick to the nice green colored &ldquo;V&rdquo; on the food we buy.</p>
