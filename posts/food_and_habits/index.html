				<p>Tough topic.I know you probably don&rsquo;t agree. Me neither.I don&rsquo;t even agree with myself, I&rsquo;m not asking you to agree with my contradicting self. I want to tackle this &ldquo;problem&rdquo; in the most logic, clear and hopefully concise manner.But first we need to put&hellip;Definitions! Heroes that always save the day. A value is a fairly abstract concept.</p>
<ul>
<li>the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something.</li>
<li>principles or standards of behaviour; one&rsquo;s judgement of what is important in life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here it is more about the second definition (thanks Oxford): One&rsquo;s judgement of what is important in life. Some properties of a value:</p>
<ul>
<li>arbitrary</li>
<li>personal</li>
<li>irrefutable</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though values can change after a long and hard work on oneself, or sudden realizations, or special events in life, here we will consider them mostly static or otherwise specified. We need to compose with our present values and live on. Collisions of values (cognitive dissonance) can make our life hard and decision making difficult. The purpose of this draft is to reduce if not eliminate cognitive dissonance. While this is a first step, we also need solid reasons to do so. Living with the disconfort of cognitive dissonance is just about an everyday challenge. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Quickie on the topic, 4 ways of coping with it. Here the scene is a person on a weight loss diet and this person eats a doughnut (which is not allowed in this diet)</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the behavior or the cognition (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat no more of this doughnut.&quot;)</li>
<li>Justify the behavior or the cognition, by changing the conflicting cognition (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m allowed to cheat my diet every once in a while.&quot;)</li>
<li>Justify the behavior or the cognition by adding new behaviors or cognitions (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spend thirty extra minutes at the gymnasium to work off the doughnut.&quot;)</li>
<li>Ignore or deny information that conflicts with existing beliefs (&ldquo;This doughnut is not a high-sugar food.&quot;)</li>

<p>I will take the case of Mr A, who is a human being perfectly standard.
A has received a standard education and is living a standard life. It does not matter specifically for our purpose.</p>
<p>A has the following values (among others of course, like love, beauty&hellip;):</p>
<ul>
<li>freedom : <strong>V1</strong></li>
<li>animals : <strong>V2</strong></li>
<li>the planet (its &ldquo;health) : <strong>V3</strong></li>
<li>his classic diet (basically everything edible, just to make it easy, but you can take the classic European diet) : <strong>V4</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming that he likes animals for standard reasons: humans tend to like &lsquo;life&rsquo; and &lsquo;wildlife&rsquo; and animals are mostly &ldquo;cute&rdquo;. He probably already established a bond with a cat, a dog, or any other animal.
We assume furthermore that A wants to stay healthy for as long as possible. (let&rsquo;s say <strong>V5</strong>)</p>
<p>This should correspond to a vast majority of people (excluding the pet thing, but it&rsquo;s just about giving him a bit of a story).
The goal here is to see what is conflicting within A&rsquo;s values, what can he do regarding this.
A concrete example is given at the end (the only one I can decently talk about).</p>
<h2 id="ucase-v2u"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->CASE V2:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="#ucase-v2u" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>Inside A&rsquo;s mind, there is a hidden conflict. It can be incoherent to like eating meat and to like animals. How can this conflict be resolved ? In practice it is usually not, the idea is simply masked : see Quickie 4. In this case, eating meat or animal products &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t hurt animals all that much&rsquo; and this places an argument using <strong>V2</strong> fairly low ranked. Let&rsquo;s take the to possible cases here. Either his love for meat/animal products is stronger than his love for animals. This is the case V4&gt;V2 that we will discuss right after. Or his love for animals is stronger than his love for meat/animal products, which makes the case V4&lt;V2.
These cases will be discussed with the idea of developing what is naturally implied by it.</p>
<h4 id="case-v4v2">CASE V4&gt;V2:<a href="#case-v4v2" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>
<p>The cognitive dissonnance can be solved by : admitting he does not really like animals (compared to meat/animal products). At this moment it means that he can eat all he wants, he can wear everything, for which V4&gt;V2 stays true. Regarding the animal suffering issue: this is okay. If he eats the classic european diet, aka the supermarket meat, milk, eggs then this makes him commit to these facts (among others):</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m okay with continuously keeping some animals pregnant and either raising their child to be pregnant regularly as well, or raising them for veal or beef</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m okay with having animals in cages to get meat or eggs out of them (yes you might buy eggs from free roaming farms, but that&rsquo;s not what are doing the people who produce your cordon bleu or your ravioli). Note that in some countries, caging animals is forbidden. Still you may want to look into France&rsquo;s intense production. 17 to 22 chichens by square meters. (yes, that&rsquo;s about the size of your keyboard per chicken)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m okay with supporting the fishing of tons of fishes at once, and letting them be dehydrated, suffocated or straight up obliterated by the weight above them on the deck of the fishing boat</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m okay with having bovines lined up to get food all day long and then be killed. Not before dehorning, castrating and branding them</li>
</ul>

(ok the two lasts are not the best, I know, but I&rsquo;ll fix it someday)So A solved his first problem: in the end he doesn&rsquo;t like animals all that much, and damn boi this steak is juicy.Or Maybe he does!</p>
<h4 id="case-v4v2-or-v4v2-sometimes-yes-sometimes-no">CASE V4~V2 or V4&lt;V2 (sometimes yes sometimes no):<a href="#case-v4v2-or-v4v2-sometimes-yes-sometimes-no" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h4>
<p>In this case, he really likes animals buuuut he also really likes their meat.
He is sort of comparably &ldquo;in between&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s understandable.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I mean, bacon dude.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In this case he cannot commit to the aforementioned facts.
Apart from the obvious choice of stopping altogether, he has another choice:
changing his habits. He has to do this with in mind his values and most notably <strong>V1</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>V1</strong> : Freedom. Is it a value that only applies to humans? Probably not.
This is a recurrent theme : we want the animals to be free as much as possible.
Free to roam, free to eat, free to lay eggs, not so free to keep them though, free to run and fly.
All this already implies a lot of things.
The animals can no longer be in cages or in extreme densities nor lined up until death.
So they live constrained lives but relatively free.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Note: This should be a case by case analysis but it would be incredibly tedious and long. Yet, we need to adapt to the sensibility of everyone, for each animal and each treatment, life conditions, people will have different levels of tolerance.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Which is normal and we <em>have</em> to accept this.</p>
<p>Maybe having some chickens running around is good, they are kinda unhappy you took those eggs but well, they can run and fly and go outside. When they die, they die, they were not really raised for meat anyway.
Well, no, it&rsquo;s too expensive to leave them alive. Fun facts time!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What typically happens is they just gas them with CO2, and asphyxiate them. Then they put them into trucks or dumpsters and they’re landfilled, or they render them,”
Laflamme said he couldn’t speak to what exactly happens when the chickens are rendered, but that it’s basically “where they turn the hens into oils and other products that are used in various industries.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are not raised for meat. They don&rsquo;t taste the same.
I cite, &ldquo;CO2 gassing is considered the most humane method&rdquo;.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/egg-laying-hens_n_59c3c93fe4b0c90504fc04a1">https://www.huffpost.com/entry/egg-laying-hens_n_59c3c93fe4b0c90504fc04a1</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
(the huffpost as a source, I feel like making a fool of myself)
But they had a nice life until they are gassed, I guess.</p>
<p>To be fair, I think it&rsquo;s not like they torture them or anything, and it&rsquo;s true, you don&rsquo;t really feel pain if gassing is done correctly, like when you sleep. Your body just goes in eco mode and then shuts down.
Though they still have to be carried to where they gas them, in huge containers and tight boxes, which is stressful as well.</p>
<p>What Mr A has to say? Maybe he&rsquo;s okay with it, after all, they had an okay life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same for free range meat chickens, they are just killed earlier.</p>
<p>So, Mr A can alleviate his issue by being more conscious of what he is consuming. &ldquo;Not torturing animals is great&rdquo; thinks Mr A.</p>
<p>But just as we will see in the next chapter, Mr A has to adapt to fit his values.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bottom line:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Mr A adjusts his consumption to his sensibility. What repulses him too much: that&rsquo;s no-no. What feels okay is&hellip; okay.
This doesn&rsquo;t stop him from eating as much meat or dairy as he wants, he just needs to be reassured that it has been produced in conformance to his sensibility. All is good. He chose the path Quickie 1 and 4. (1 for changing his ways then 4 by saying hey that&rsquo;s okay in the end, now they don&rsquo;t really suffer that much)</p>
<p>If he decides that reducing the cognitive dissonance is not enough, he feels like he needs to go full Q.1. path, then he stops for good, as best as he can. (Within the limits of all his other values. If he feels this is limiting too much his own freedom, or happiness, or social relationships, he may want to use path 2 for a bit, or to adjust how he feels about all this. No one said it&rsquo;s easy!)</p>
<p><strong>CASE V3:</strong></p>
<p>In face with environmental challenges, it&rsquo;s normal that Mr A feels bad about consuming beef or meat in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With emissions estimated at 7.1 gigatonnes CO2 -eq per annum, representing 14.5 percent of human-induced GHG emissions, the livestock sector plays an important role in climate change. Beef and cattle milk production account for the majority of emissions, respectively contributing 41 and 20 percent of the sector’s emissions. While pig meat and poultry meat and eggs contribute respectively 9 percent and 8 percent to the sector’s emissions. The strong projected growth of this production will result in higher emission shares and volumes over time. Feed production and processing, and enteric fermentation from ruminants are the two main sources of emissions, representing 45 and 39 percent of sector emissions, respectively. Manure storage and processing represent 10 percent. The remainder is attributable to the processing and transportation of animal products. Included in feed production, the expansion of pasture and feed crops into forests accounts for about 9 percent of the sector’s emissions. Cutting across categories, the consumption of fossil fuel along the sector supply chains accounts for about 20 percent of sector emissions.Yes. That&rsquo;s a fair amount.Especially when we know we could use the land for&hellip; just forest ? Amazon rainforest? Being torn to pieces to plant soy to give to cattle?What has Mr A to say about it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why carbon emissions matter : <a href="https://skepticalscience.com/co2-measurements-uncertainty.htmhttps://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/Side">https://skepticalscience.com/co2-measurements-uncertainty.htmhttps://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/Side</a></p>
<p>note: this topic does not touch only the cattle raising industry. Transportation, energy, industry&hellip; Yes, Amazon is a part of the problem. That&rsquo;s taking conscience of a far bigger issue. Note that this is not for meat especially. All these animals, making milk, eggs and stuff, we need to transport, raise and everything much like for meat! Cheese is, for instance, very close to meat in almost every regard (related to environment).</p>
<p><strong>CASE V3&lt;V2:</strong></p>
<p>He cares about the planet but come on man, it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s going that bad. I&rsquo;m still going to work just fine. We have the AC in the metro now.</p>
<p>Supporting the animal products industry means accepting these claims:</p>
<pre><code>* I'm okay with supporting an industry that accounts for a large portion of emission of greenhouse gases. (14.5%)
* I'm okay with supporting an industry that is deforesting significant parts of the amazon rainforest and forests worldwide for crops 
* I'm okay with contributing with my dietary consumption habits to global warming
* I'm okay with supporting an industry that destroys natural habitats, be it on land or under the sea
* I'm okay with 60% of the total crop industry going to feed the cattle, even if we would need about just the amount we feed our cattle (hence, 60%) to feed the entire planet (of course we need to change the crops, not soy everywhere)
* I prefer to eat meat and dairies, even knowing all, this rather than changing my ways
</code></pre>
<p>In agreement with what is important in life according to you Mr A, then all is fine. (even though you might not make only friends)</p>
<p><strong>CASE V3  ~ V2:</strong></p>
<p>This is the case for probably a heavy portion of people. Animals are about as important as the planet, so there again, we tend to a compromise.To tackle this issue, there are again multiple choices. A may choose path 1 and change entirely your way to the best option so far: plant based diet. A may choose path 1 and 4, by changing part of you diet, and say that now your conscience is at peace. As long as your conscience is ok with it, it&rsquo;s good. These changes can include smaller or bigger changes:
* buy meat and diaries from local farmers, might be fairly expensive and not always possible but the impact on environment is reduced (on top of them being usually free to roam)
* consume/buy reduced amount of meat and diaries, especially avoiding meat from mass production
* going vegetarian = no meat, which is good. If you don&rsquo;t buy cheese instead, which, from an environmental point of view is almost the same
* going pescetarian = no meat but fish is okay. Maybe the destruction of the seashore habitat and the mass fishing of salmons (a predator specie (trophic level 4 on average) involved in a lot of self regulation loops for maintaining ecosystems) is okay
* replacing milk by almond/soy/other milk, replacing butter by margarine and so on and so forth, just not commiting to any particular style but improving what doesn&rsquo;t feel like a restriction of freedom</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SalmonNote">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SalmonNote</a></p>
<p>that this is probably the way most people choose. For instance some begin vegetarian, then &ldquo;progress&rdquo; through the journey of being in agreement with one&rsquo;s values step by step. Because it is not comfortable to change drastically one&rsquo;s behavior, this makes it complicated because it can conflicts highly with short term happiness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why (a part of the reasons why) a step by step approach is more interesting. Simply following a classic loop:Initial state -&gt; include new small behavior change (let&rsquo;s say, no cow milk) -&gt; adaptation phase (what works best for me, comparing where it is the most problematic, how your usual recipe become blablabla) -&gt; integration of the behavior (making the now adapted behavior part of the initial state) -&gt; initial stateInitial -&gt; perturbation -&gt; adaptation -&gt; integration -&gt; initialOnce the behavior is integrated, Mr A will not feel the &ldquo;need&rdquo; of the previous behavior. Eating meat is not something you miss, nor milk (never liked it anyway ._.), nor cheese.It does not mean that you can not enjoy them anymore (if you consume some again, for very specific reasons, I mean, life happens).Meat still tastes good and milkshakes are still milkshakesIt&rsquo;s just that Mr A know what it entails.A small addition: each time you consume something, it is a decision. (except for very specific cases that some distorted mind could think of, like mine)Bottom line:Once again, it&rsquo;s not about all in all out, it&rsquo;s just about how animal raising and processing impacts the planet. Both in terms of CO2 emission and ecosystem and habitat.Mr A needs to compose with his sensitivity about deforestation, overfishing, farming methods (fertilizers that goes into streams of water, spread of diseases&hellip;).Once he knows how sensitive he is about each topics he can choose the appropriate reaction for each case, and why not doing so with the &ldquo;improvement loop&quot;Some Sourceshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonancehttps://phys.org/news/2018-10-meat-affects-environment-cows-climate.htmlAnother point of view, heavily biased but much more elaborated.he says: saying &ldquo;humans need micro and macro nutrients for good health&quot;Probably to talk about essential amino acids, which is the fancy name of vitamins.One claim is that meat is more nutrient dense than vegetables. Perfectly true.And even: protein is of better quality. And it has B12.On the other hand, we can supplement B12 like we do for iodine in salt or vitamin C wherever they can put it, or even calcium enriched drinks and so on. yet, it is shown that most people lack vitamin D, magnesium among other stuff. So let&rsquo;s just supplement. Eating meat twice a day apparently doesn&rsquo;t change anything. Some of the olympic champions are vegans. It is hence possible to have intense physical activity while being vegan.Yes, let&rsquo;s use technology to meet seemlessly our needs.You&rsquo;ll never read even a part of it but I put it here:The report (corrected) of livestock emission of CO2 and stuff.
