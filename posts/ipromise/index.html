<p>Before writing became very common, words were used to bind people. &ldquo;You have my word&rdquo; is an expression very similar in meaning to a promise. The word &ldquo;word&rdquo; here implies that the act of saying a binding word or expression, such as &ldquo;I will do X&rdquo; is, in itself, binding. At this time, what could be called honor would ensures the person would do what he commited to. A person would lack honor when not doing as he said. Honor was important. People needed to rely on something to assert the trustworthiness of someone. The honor status of people would be known and people knew who to trust.</p>
<p>When writing and contract law became commonplace, honor became unnecessary for trust. Now you trust the paper and the pen, and the system. Honor isn&rsquo;t a thing to protect anymore. (Not that it&rsquo;s a bad thing) Does modern society has a Honor system? That&rsquo;s another debate entirely. We still promise things, but the weight is far lower. Is that true? Maybe the internal moral compass has changed. As far as my experience goes, I didn&rsquo;t live centuries earlier, and I don&rsquo;t know if people were true to their word more than people are today. My experience of today though, is that most promises people made to me ended unmet. I have the feeling that people do not feel strongly tied by the promise. This leads to a heavy distorsion between what we say and what we think of it.</p>
<h2 id="social-contract">Social contract<a href="#social-contract" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>What does &ldquo;I promise to do X&rdquo; means to you? Let&rsquo;s say, A says that to B, and assume they are friends not negociating a contract, and cunning is not involved: both are of good faith.
Does it mean that A has to do X, now that it&rsquo;s promised? What should B do or think if A doesn&rsquo;t do X? And what if A tried but didn&rsquo;t succeed?</p>
<p>I suggest looking at it this way. At the start, A and B didn&rsquo;t owe anything to each other. You can replace X by &ldquo;call you tomorrow&rdquo; or &ldquo;will visit you next week&rdquo; or &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be late&rdquo;.
Then, for whatever reason, A promised to do X to B. This now creates a different relation. B is expecting something of A. This expectation can only have negative outcomes: either X is done and that was expected, it&rsquo;s neutral, either X is not done and B views it negatively.
Even for something small, fairly insignificant, ever if B doesn&rsquo;t really care that X is done, having failed to fulfill a promise changes something.
It changes who A is as a person. A is a little bit more a person whose word is not reliable. B is likely to think less of A regarding trustworthiness, and future promises could be met with a raised eyebrow. This process can very well be unconscious, so no amount of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay, I don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; would change it.</p>
<h2 id="i-love-you-darling-i-promise-i-will-never-leave-you">I love you darling, I promise I will never leave you<a href="#i-love-you-darling-i-promise-i-will-never-leave-you" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>In social context, what do promises mean?
What A likely tried to achieve, was to show commitment, or affection toward B. It can show confidence in the ability to do X. It is supposed to leave B to believe &ldquo;X will be taken care of, you can rest assured&rdquo;. A having failed to do X, B went from happy to have someone&rsquo;s help (or anything that X is about), to being disappointed and having to find another way, losing time along the way, or being prepared for X and not having it.</p>
<p>I can see this in social contexts, where promising looks to me like an &ldquo;affection commitment&rdquo;. People don&rsquo;t like uncertainty, so, promising helps alleviate the problem. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a promise now! Even if in the end, it&rsquo;s unmet, at least the previous feeling of uncertainty has been erased (temporarily). It&rsquo;s a tool to alleviate uncertainty. Especially in insecure couples, where one feels the need to promise to visit every week, or to call or whatever. &ldquo;I promise I will always love you&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all fun and games until it&rsquo;s a chore. It is also a way to show that they are ready to put the affection/consideration of the other into play. Indeed, failing to meet the expectations is essentially letting the other have the right to judge you for not giving what is owed, albeit more often than not it&rsquo;s socially downplayed, but unconsciously important<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
Why doing that to oneself? More precisely, why bet on one&rsquo;s own future feelings? Promising neverending love doesn&rsquo;t make it happen. (Love should probably be redefined then)</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-then">What to do then?<a href="#what-to-do-then" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>The point is, having promised something is mostly a negative experience. Failing to meet someone&rsquo;s expectations (when one initially wanted to) is mostly a negative experience.
Even if there is no hard binding, a promise is still a promise and will alter the opinion others have of you, but also the one you have of yourself.</p>
<p>A significantly more sensible approach would be to simply not promise anything. If you want to do it, just do it. Or try. Say you&rsquo;ll try, do your best, that&rsquo;s all. If the other person can&rsquo;t deal with that level of uncertainty, then maybe they have some work on themselves to do.
A promise is an unnecessary source of stress. For some reason, promises have been romanticized. Also, as hard as it might be, when someone asks you to promise something, refuse. For your own good, do not let people ask things from you. If you want to do it, do it. Truth is, promises are not needed for things to happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not much. Don&rsquo;t put yourself in a position where others expect something from you. (very general (maybe bold) statement, but it&rsquo;s here in the context of promises. Of course, it can be a tool to play with others' expectations, and that&rsquo;s for you to see if you can wield the tool, or if you&rsquo;ll end up being the social instrument.)</p>
<h2 id="the-proof">The &ldquo;proof&rdquo;<a href="#the-proof" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>Successfully meeting a promise is rewarding/rewarded. The reward is $R$.<br>
Successfully meeting a promise is difficult and a probability of success can be affected. The probability is $P$.<br>
Unsuccessfully meeting a promise is negatively rewarding/rewarded. The negative reward is $N$.<br>
The Promise is $X$.<br>
The expected reward is $E[X]=RP+N(1-P)$.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s rephrase.<br>
You&rsquo;re in a casino.<br>
You have a chance $P$ to win the prize.<br>
The prize is $R$.<br>
The entry price in $N$.<br>
The gamble is $X$.<br>
The expected reward is $E[X]=RP+N(1-P)$.</p>
<p>A promise is essentially a social gamble. Is it wrong? Not necessarily. One just needs to remember that not playing is often the way to outsmart the system. Especially when odds are not in your favor. The social reward of the promise is actually quite small, but it exists. A small dose of dopamine, probably. The disappointment being mostly unconsious (but orders of magnitude more impactful) it is downweighted by our short-term idiotic brain.</p>
<p>The reality is that odds are always in your favour when you say &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;ll do my best, but I don&rsquo;t promise it will be done&rdquo;. Then you have the reward if you succeed. The negative isn&rsquo;t so bad anymore. The other person isn&rsquo;t disappointed. Win-Win.</p>

<p>I did not prove here that the more or less unconscious effect exists and is important. That&rsquo;s a hidden (not so hidden anymore) premise. Do you think that it plays a role? How big is it?
