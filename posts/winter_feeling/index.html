<p>It&rsquo;s cold outside. Your nose is hardened by the cold and it starts running. Your fingertips are numb and your gloves don&rsquo;t keep the warmth enough. Your breath creates wonderful volutes that your eyes, squinting through the wind, sometimes contemplate.
And you find in your pockets, the cold metal that would deliver you. Your fingers have trouble holding it straight and turning it, but it clicks, it opens, and here you are.<br>
I turn a page.</p>

<h2 id="home">Home:<a href="#home" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p><em>I want to go home</em> you said. And here you are, pushing the door. I hear these familiar footsteps, this familiar breathing. The noise of the coat hanger, the shoes placed near mine.</p>

<p><em>The wood in the fireplace crackles.</em></p>

<p>A warm atmosphere envelops you now. It&rsquo;s still cold in here, but there&rsquo;s another kind of warm. The hot chocolate is next to my tea, waiting for you. As I put down my book, I smile looking at your red nose while you take the plaid placed close to the fire. All wrapped up, I hug you on the couch, all the while adjusting the plaid on your shoulders. Your rub you hands together to warm them up, and then wrap them around the cup of hot chocolate.<br/>
I take my book and continue where I left off.</p>

<p><em>The fireplace moans again.</em></p>

<p>As you are warming up, you put your head on my shoulder, your hair tickling my neck. And with the eyes closed, you feel your body going from numb to resting. Your breathing is calming rapidly.
The soft movement of my head while reading, my inaudible breathing, the smell of chocolate. Your adventurous hand caresses my arm, but the cold reality makes it flee back under the plaid. A tender smile rewards your efforts, while your sigh.<br>
I turn a page.<br>
You smile smelling my scent on my neck and place there a kiss before taking a sip of chocolate. A long breathe. Yellow orange and red were disputing the space on the walls. You gazed around with this calm and posed look, with the eyes half closed, full of appreciation.</p>

<p><em>The fireplace sings.</em></p>

<p>You place your head on my lap. You feel like you belong. You feel like this is where you want to be.<br>
I turn a page.<br>
As your consciousness sinks more and more, you feel a gentle hand stroking your hair, pushing you further into bliss.</p>

<p>Just before letting yourself leave the realm of consciousness you think:</p>

<p><center><em>I am home.</em></center></p>

<h2 id="context">Context:<a href="#context" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>Note: The characters do not have any specified sex or gender. Given the inspiration, it was naturally a man-woman scenario for me, but I like it in any configuration. For this purpose, I removed every gender connoted thing. I had written &ldquo;hair cascading on your cheeks&rdquo;, which, statistically, makes it more likely to be a woman. I replaced it by &ldquo;your hair tickling my neck&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s more &lsquo;bonding&rsquo; and more gender neutral. Please imagine whoever you want. (by the way, the hot chocolate is homemade so you can also make it suit your taste&hellip; with a bit a cinnamon?)</p>

<p>I really like this kind of atmosphere, calm quiet, tender, accepting. You may have noticed that no words were exchanged. The idea sprouted from a friend with whom I cuddle a fair bit saying <em>I want to go home and lie down for a bit</em>. Of course she meant her home, and she meant going in bed and nap or rest. But for some reason, I wanted to be this person reading a book, I wanted to be this kind, comforting presence. I rewrote the whole text I had written in the first place, and I hope it sounds better.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments:<a href="#comments" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>I wanted to show the characters know each other so well that he simply knows what is happening in the head of his companion. Just by her breathing, the way the footsteps resonates on the floor, all the myriad of infinitely subtle clues and cues, he knows perfectly how she feels. Communication happens, but no words.</p>

<p>I had the idea of placing the fireplace as something exterior, that is simply <em>here</em> and simply <em>happens</em>. I created a gradation from very descriptive to highly subjective regarding the fireplace, which also goes with the state of the arriving companion: cold and numb, warming up and calming down, comfy and resting. I also wanted a sort of parallel with the static characted, he&rsquo;s not doing much, his state doesn&rsquo;t change but everything would be so different without him. I thought about making it less obvious that he made the hot chocolate, that he placed the plaid in front of the fireplace. That it could&rsquo;ve been here all along. I think it would actually go against the purpose of this text. It should be simple, easy to understand, because what&rsquo;s important is not about deciphering, it&rsquo;s about feeling, it has to flow. I hope it flows a bit.</p>

<p>Turning the pages was an idea in combination with the fireplace to slow down the pace. The point is to read slowly, calmly and letting the atmosphere sink into you. The funny thing is, when I wrote it, I was imagining myself as the companion character, and imagining how I felt, tired, cold, numb, how I would&rsquo;ve done things, and finally how I would&rsquo;ve described it from someone else&rsquo;s point of view. Actually, I almost started to lie down and sleep. It always gets me.</p>

<p>Stay warm!</p>
