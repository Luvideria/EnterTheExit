<p>I have a dragon in my room. One may ask &ldquo;Show me your dragon&rdquo; but I cannot. Sadly, it is small, very very small. And it is fast, very very fast. One may ask &ldquo;Then how do you know it exists ?&rdquo; Well it&rsquo;s simple. Sometimes I feel like I tripped over something but no cable, no furniture just a perfectly flat floor, as if it just carelessly bumped into me. I regularly sense a peculiar yet very faint smell, like something caught fire. Though after inspection, nothing burnt, no cooking, no worn out cable or electronic device going crazy. It can only be the fiery breath of the dragon, probably roasting its meal. I have no idea about what this dragon eats though. Maybe it picks something from the trash ? Or maybe it steals from the fridge ? I never noticed such a thing, but I suppose such a tiny dragon doesn&rsquo;t need much. A fly or two from time to time may very well be enough for all I know&hellip; One may say &ldquo;Oh but that&rsquo;s nothing, you&rsquo;re probably imagining stuff&rdquo;. I can only tell you what I experience, but I cannot make you experience my feelings. Let me tell you more about the dragon.</p>

<p>When the wind chimes through my shutters and the sky covers itself of its starry blanket as my consciousness fades, I can hear it, I can feel it. Just next to my head, a calm breathing, a warm breeze.
As soon as I try to gather my still sleeping thoughts, it vanishes. I try to place my hand where I felt it but the mattress isn&rsquo;t warmer, the air isn&rsquo;t agitated, it simply disappeared. But it was here.
Once I was sick and I had terrible stomach pain. Going to sleep was awful, I couldn&rsquo;t get rest because of the pain, but couldn&rsquo;t stay awake because I was exhausted.
When the clouds made everything dark and the wind howled its best to free the stars, I lost myself to exhaustion. A soft warmth pressing against my belly, just like a hot stone, perfectly adjusted.
The hard scales heated up by the ardent inner fire of the dragon made for a very regenerating sleep. The sun just began to rise when I noticed that I slept on the back. I never sleep
on the back. I thought it was because of the stomach pain, maybe this position helps. But after testing, the pain is actually more intense when my body is on the back because the whole belly is extended compared to foetal position. I can only think it was to allow the dragon to heal me somehow. My stomach pain was significantly better this day, and although I was not cured, my state was now tolerable.</p>

<p>I do not need you to believe in my dragon, my dragon is very real for me and I like him very much. I believe he is my friend and in any case I will always welcome him and his friends. But I do not care if someone does not believe in my dragon. You might be a scientist thirsty for knowledge, or a psychologist looking for an interesting case. Maybe you want to capture my dragon and study him, or make me sit and interrogate me. Maybe you just want to prove me I&rsquo;m wrong, that my dragon is nothing but delusions of an imaginative mind. Maybe. But I won&rsquo;t let you kill my dragon.</p>

<p>You are not allowed any experiment. You are not allowed to make me understand what I actually tripped over or that the sound I heard was something else entirely. You are not allowed to make me doubt that the warmth I felt wasn&rsquo;t his. My dragon will live on until he decides to leave.</p>

<p>The picture is from me, during a trip in Belle-île. One of my first pictures of the stars. My fuji x100s in not made for that, and to be honest, I don&rsquo;t like it so much anymore (the picture, not the camera).
I added it when doing the post, more to see how to put images and figure out a way to put them online easily.</p>

<h3 id="context">Context<a href="#context" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>

<p>When I wrote this poem I was still active on a forum and there I exchanged with people persuaded by astrology, by Christiannism, by a lot of beliefs that sometimes hurt them more than they help. Some of them were very depressed.</p>

<p>I wanted to share a part of my understanding of this situation.</p>

<p>I feel sorry that they need to go this far in the nonsense to find salvation. Yet, they do feel better, some people find in these something that society, psychiatrists or their job do not offer. And that is not their fault.</p>

<p>And this is very good and I am delighted that they find something that works for them.</p>

<p>Yet they start to build a sentimental, emotional bond with it. And as the little girl (I imagine that, but it&rsquo;s sexist, sorry) will outgrow her enthusiastic imagination, they should also outgrow their beliefs. Not in the sense that they should part with them, in the sense that it is not needed anymore. In the state I saw a lot of people (a lot is actually not even statistically sensible, but it&rsquo;s more than most people dealt with) they were like imprisoned by their beliefs. They could not evolve enough to be able to choose if they wanted to live with or without.
This is saddening.</p>

<p>This is a topic (&ldquo;outgrowing beliefs&rdquo;) that I am fairly sensitive to. I think I have a lot of things to think about on this topic.</p>

<h3 id="comments">Comments<a href="#comments" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>

<p>I decided to share this as-is, without modifications, even if I think I could improve it. (It was written 5 months ago)</p>

<p>I like the way it sounds childish, but the end feels off. It does not feel like a child anymore, and it&rsquo;s more all the frustration that was in me that talked. In some sense, I feel like a gradient of childishness in this poem. Maybe that&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>Very little rewriting happened (I would definitely use different images instead of twice stars : &ldquo;starry blanket&rdquo;, &ldquo;free the stars&rdquo;)
but at the time I had no intention to publish it, so I did not really care.</p>

<p>I wanted to illustrate how people end up getting into these.. fields? esoterism? I don&rsquo;t really know, but you get it: mostly irrationnal stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Confirmation bias</strong>: Looking for proofs that aren&rsquo;t really there, ignoring all the clues that point in other directions
The stone moment illustrate how vicious life can be at giving you information.</p>

<p>It can look like you got better, but actually the night was just nice and the sleep was in the end of good quality. In any case she would feel better and better. Let&rsquo;s not neglect placebo effect that may very well apply here.</p>

<p>There is also this tendency to not use <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Ockham&rsquo;s razor</a></strong>: she thinks it was to help the dragon heal her that she slept on the back but it could be a misplaced pillow because, while trying to get asleep, she kept moving around, moving pillows, or whatever other reason.</p>
